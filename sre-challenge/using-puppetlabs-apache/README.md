# SRE Challenge:
### Challenge:
Using a modern configuration management tool of your choice (i.e. Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack, etc.) configure a Linux host as a secure web server. The server should be configured to serve a page reading “SRE CHALLENGE” over HTTPS.
### Deliverables:
#### Install and configure a web server on a Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS host
#### Configure https (a self-signed certificate is acceptable for this challenge)
#### Configure http redirect to https
#### Configure the http/https homepage to display "SRE CHALLENGE"
#### Configure host-based firewall for ports 22, 80 and 443
#### Create an automated test to verify the web server is listening on port 443.

# Solution:
I'm going to use puppet to do this configuration automation with Docker in my local laptop. This solution relies on the open source module puppetlabs-apache https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apache/0.9.0. It also relies on a module firewall from puppetlabs https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/firewall for the firewall configuration I believe this is better solution because it can support all kinds of OS for httpd installation and configuration.
## Assumptions:
Have Docker installed in local host. If not, please go to docker.com https://www.docker.com and download the docker engine and install it.

## Steps:
### Test it with puppetagent docker container
#### Git clone SRE-Challenge repo from GitHub
```
cd ~; git clone https://github.com/rongyj/sre-challenge.git
```
#### Pull docker image for puppet agent
```
docker pull rongyj/puppet-agent4-c7-systemd
```
#### Run puppetagent docker container with right mapping for the port and volumes
```
docker run  -d --name puppetagent --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt seccomp:unconfined --hostname puppetagent -p 8443:443 -p 8080:80 -v ~/sre-challenge/using-puppetlabs-apache/agent/hosts:/etc/hosts -v ~/sre-challenge/using-puppetlabs-apache:/etc/puppet --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW rongyj/puppet-agent4-c7-systemd bash -c "/usr/sbin/init"
```
if you see error as below:
```
docker run  -d --name puppetagent --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt seccomp:unconfined --hostname puppetagent -p 8443:443 -p 8080:80 -v ~/sre-challenge/using-puppetlabs-apache/agent/hosts:/etc/hosts -v ~/sre-challenge/using-puppetlabs-apache:/etc/puppet --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW rongyj/puppet-agent4-c7-systemd bash -c "/usr/sbin/init"
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/puppetagent" is already in use by container 667cbbad0c17fb5a435a9832b8dbc20e73e61a01aaf23e0271e61b37b5e8a76b. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name..
See 'docker run --help'.
```
you need stop the container "puppetagent" and remove it as below from local host and retry
```
$ docker stop puppetagent
$ docker rm puppetagent
```

It will map the local port 8443 to the docker container port 443 and local port 8080 to container port 80.
#### Connect to the puppetagent docker container
```
# docker exec -it puppetagent /bin/bash
[root@puppetagent /]#puppet apply --modulepath=/etc/puppet/modules /etc/puppet/manifests/init.pp

```
#### Test it from local host browser
type "http://localhost:8080/" in a browser and it will be redirected to "https://localhost:8443/" automatically and the "SRE-Challenge" will be displayed. If the localhost cannot be resolved, you need edit your local /etc/hosts to add "127.0.0.1 localhost localhost " to it and try again.
From the above container terminal and the iptables -L can show the list of the firewall rules:
```
[root@puppetagent manifests]# iptables -L
